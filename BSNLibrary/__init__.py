"""
Robot Framework Library for generating a random BSN (Burger Service Nummer, i.e. a
Dutch citizen service number) for test purposes.

A BSN is used in Netherlands to identify a person for government organisations, see
[https://www.government.nl/topics/personal-data/citizen-service-number-bsn|
this information of the Dutch government]. The number consists of 9 digits and has
to pass the eleven test.

This test can be explained with the example 211551557. Each digit is multiplied with
its position and the results are added up together:

``(9*2) + (8*1) + (7*1) + (6*5) + (5*5) + (4*1) + (3*5) + (2*5) - (1*7) = 110``

Note that the digit in position 1 is subtracted from the other results. The total
sum can be divided by 11, which means that this number has passed the eleven test.

This library generates BSNs for test purposes in the sense that it generates random
9 digit numbers that pass the eleven test. By coincidence a generated number could
be a real person's BSN. Yet this library cannot violate such a person's privacy,
because it cannot tell you whether a number belongs to a real person or not, nor
will it provide you with any personal data related to a BSN. Obviously you should
only use this library in test environments.

This library brings the following features to Robot Framework:
- generating a valid BSN
- generating a BSN that is unique within the current test run
- generating a number that will not pass the eleven test
- generating a BSN that starts with specific digits
- generating a BSN that is less than 9 digits long
- checking if a given number passes the eleven test
- returning a list of BSNs generated during the current test run
- clearing the list of BSNs generated during the current test run

Possible use cases
- A test message that is processed by one or more systems can be tracked by its unique BSN
- Creating messages with BSNs in a certain range that leads to a certain response from a system or stub
- Checking whether a test message contains a valid BSN

    Generates a number between 100000000 and 799999999 that passes the eleven test. By default
    this BSN is unique within a test run and is added to a list that can be accessed with Get
    Generated BSNs

    ``given`` argument can be used to specify the first digits of the number to be generated, thus
    restricting the range within which the number is generated.
    - To generate a number outside the default range, specify 0, 8 or 9 as the first digit
    - To validate a number, specify the complete number (the number of digits is equal to ``length``)
    - To generate an invalid number, specify '999' as the first three digits
    - The ``given`` string can only contain digits
    - The number of digits should be smaller than ``length - 1`` or equal to ``length``

    ``length`` argument can be used to generate a number of less than 9 positions, for example
    when a BSN of 8 positions is needed.
    - Only values 6, 7, 8 or 9 are allowed

    If ``unique`` is given a ``False`` value the keyword no longer enforces that the generated
    BSN is unique within a test run, nor will it add the generated number to the list of generated
    BSNs. Can be used in situations that uniqueness is not a requirement and enforcing it leads
    to problems.
